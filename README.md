# YAPPE
Enter input parameters into "input_deck_YAPPE.m". "Input_notes.txt" is a good starting point for the input parameters.

Also make sure to change the output directory to match the location of the desired output folder in "input_deck_YAPPE.m" and "batch_runner_runner_YAPPE.m".

Run "batch_runner_runner_YAPPE.m" to start the simulation.
